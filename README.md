# Ultimate X Game Engine
Game Engine built with Scala

The project involves investigating and implementing three main programming language paradigms:
- Object-oriented programming (Javascript)
- Functional programming (Scala)
- Logical programming (Prolog)

The first part of the project focuses on implementing a generic game engine for drawing various board games, including Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4, Checkers, Chess, Sudoku, and 8-Queens, using both object-oriented (Javascript) and functional (Scala) programming paradigms.

The second part of the project involves implementing solvers for the Sudoku and 8-Queens games using the logical programming paradigm (Prolog).

The project aims to showcase the differences between these programming paradigms and provide an understanding of when to use each one. The deliverables include source code for both implementations, an executable jar for each implementation, and a report detailing the application of at least two main features of each paradigm, the main differences between the two implementations, and the pros and cons of using each paradigm in this project.
